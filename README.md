## React Employee Directory 

This is a sample employee directory built in React that allows users to view their entire employee database. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. 

### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
